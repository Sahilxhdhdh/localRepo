Depending on your CI/CD pipeline, you may need additional plugins for integration with tools like Gi


Q)Pipelining

jenkins uses ci/cd pipeline to streamline the work of devops teams.
A pipeline defines the stages through which code changes pass from development to production, ensuring that every change is built, tested, and deployed reliably and efficiently.

There are two types of Jenkins pipelines: scripted and declarative. 
A scripted pipeline gives developers more control over the script so that new code can be injected into the pipeline at any time to update and change tasks. 
A declarative pipeline uses predefined constructs for simpler coding, but that also makes it more rigid than scriptedÂ pipelines.

Q)What is Continuous Integration (CI)?

 Continuous Integration is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, 
followed by automated builds and tests.

Q)What is a Jenkins agent?
 A Jenkins agent is a machine or a process that performs the tasks defined in the pipeline, like building, testing, and deploying.

Q)What is SCM in Jenkins?
Answer: SCM (Source Control Management) in Jenkins refers to the system that manages and tracks code changes. 
Jenkins integrates with SCM tools like Git, SVN, and Mercurial to trigger builds when changes are detected.

Q)What are Jenkins plugins?

Jenkins plugins are modules that extend the functionality of Jenkins. 
Examples include Git Plugin, Maven Plugin, Slack Notification Plugin, and many others.

Q)What are the stages of a Jenkins pipeline?

Stages are logical divisions in a Jenkins pipeline representing different phases like build, test, deploy, etc.
